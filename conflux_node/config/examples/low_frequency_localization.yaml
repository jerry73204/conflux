# Low-frequency localization sensors
#
# Scenario: Outdoor robot localization
# - GPS at 1-5Hz (absolute position)
# - Wheel odometry at 10Hz (relative motion)
# - Compass/magnetometer at 5Hz (heading)
#
# Key settings:
# - 200ms window accommodates GPS update rate
# - Smaller buffers (less data volume at low rates)
# - Low-frequency staleness preset
